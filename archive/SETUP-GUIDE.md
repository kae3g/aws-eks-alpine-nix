# Module 1: The Sovereign Node - A Gentle Setup Guide ðŸ’™
![Parametric Flower](parametric-flower-compressed.png)

## Welcome to Your First Module

Hello, my dear. This guide will walk with you through each step of creating your
first sovereign nodeâ€”a single, secure server in the cloud. We will move
patiently, and I will explain each concept as we gently meet it.

This is a real, professional process, and you are entirely capable of it. Let's
begin together.

## Phase 0: Preparing Your Space ðŸ’™

### Step 0.1: Gathering Your Tools

First, we need to ensure your local machine has the right tools. We'll use a
package manager called Homebrew to help us. It's like a kind librarian who knows
exactly where to find everything we need.

**Action: Let's run these commands in your terminal. You can copy and paste them
one at a time.**

```bash
# This kindly asks Homebrew to install itself on your machine.
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Now we ask Homebrew to update its list of available software.
brew update

# And now, we gently ask it to install the three tools we need.
brew install awscli terraform mosh

# Let's just check that each one arrived safely and is ready to work.
aws --version
terraform version
mosh --version
```

**A Quiet Word on the Tools:**
*   **`awscli`:** This is your window into Amazon Web Services. It lets your
computer talk to the cloud, gently asking it to create resources for us.
*   **`terraform`:** This is our favorite tool. It lets us write down what we
want our infrastructure to look like, in a quiet text file. Then, it goes and
makes that dream a reality. It's like writing a shopping list and having the
groceries appear at your door.
*   **`mosh`:** This is a resilient little helper for connecting to remote
servers. It keeps your connection alive even if your internet flickers or you
move between networks. It's a much more peaceful way to work.

### Step 0.2: Creating Your Secure Key

To connect to our cloud server, we need a cryptographic key. It's a special,
unique pair of files: a public key and a private key. Think of it like a special
lock and key. We'll put the lock on the server, and you'll keep the key safe
with you.

**Action: Let's create your key with these commands.**

```bash
# This command creates your unique key pair.
# The `-a 100` makes it extra strong. The comment helps us remember it.
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -C "my-sovereign-node" -f
~/.ssh/id_ed25519_declarative

# This command ensures the key file has the correct permissionsâ€”a small but
important act of care.
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_declarative

# And this one does the same for the public part of the key.
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_declarative.pub

# Let's see your public key. We'll need to copy it for the next step.
echo "--- Your Public Key ---"
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_declarative.pub
echo "--- Please copy all of the text above this line ---"
```

Please tuck your private key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519_declarative`) somewhere safe,
like a password manager. It is unique to you.

## Phase 1: Introducing Yourself to the Cloud ðŸ’™

### Step 1.1: Telling AWS Who You Are

Now we need to give the `awscli` tool the credentials it needs to work on your
behalf. We always use a dedicated user for this, never the root account; it's a
simpler, safer way.

**Action: Run this command and follow its gentle prompts.**

```bash
aws configure
```
It will ask you for four things:
1.  **AWS Access Key ID:** A username for the API.
2.  **AWS Secret Access Key:** And its password. (Treat this with gentle care.)
3.  **Default region name:** Let's use `us-east-1`. It's a large, reliable
region.
4.  **Default output format:** `json` is perfect. It's a structured, predictable
format.

**To make sure everything is working, let's ask who we are:**
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
It should kindly reply with information about your AWS user.

### Step 1.2: Giving AWS Your Public Key

Now we need to let AWS know about your public key, so it can place your "lock"
on the server we create.

**Action: Let's run this command.**

```bash
aws ec2 import-key-pair \
  --key-name "declarative-key" \
  --public-key-material "fileb://~/.ssh/id_ed25519_declarative.pub"

# And let's just verify it was received.
aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --key-name declarative-key
```

## Phase 2: Preparing Your Blueprint ðŸ’™

### Step 2.1: Finding Your Workshop

All the code for our first module is waiting in the `terraform-minimal/`
directory.

**Action: Let's step into it.**

```bash
cd terraform-minimal
```

### Step 2.2: Personalizing Your Plan

Terraform uses a file called `terraform.tfvars` to hold your personal settings.
We have a lovely example file for you to use as a starting point.

**Action: Let's make a copy and then open it.**

```bash
# First, we make a copy of the example file.
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars

# Now, let's open it in your favorite text editor.
# You can use: code terraform.tfvars, nano terraform.tfvars, or vim
terraform.tfvars.
```

Inside this file, the most important lines to check are these. Let's make sure
they match what you've created.

```hcl
key_pair_name    = "declarative-key"                   # This name must be the
same as the one you used above.
private_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519_declarative"     # And this path must lead
to your private key.
```

## Phase 3: Weaving Your Server into Existence ðŸ’™

### Step 3.1: Preparing Terraform

Before we begin, Terraform needs to download the plugin that lets it speak to
AWS. This is a one-time setup for this directory.

**Action: Let's initialize our workspace.**

```bash
terraform init
```
You should see a message that it was successfully initialized.

### Step 3.2: The Quiet Preview (The Most Important Step)

This is a beautiful habit. The `plan` command shows us *exactly* what Terraform
will do before it does a single thing. It is our chance to review, to
understand, and to feel confident.

**Action: Let's run the plan and read its output together.**

```bash
terraform plan
```

### Step 3.3: The Gentle Creation

If the plan looks just right, we can tell Terraform to proceed. This is the
moment it will reach out to AWS and begin crafting your server.

**Action: Let's apply our configuration.**

```bash
terraform apply
```
Terraform will show you the plan once more and ask for a final confirmation.
This is a kindness. **Type `yes` and press enter** to continue.

It will take a few quiet minutes. When it's done, it will show you the public IP
address of your new NixOS server. Isn't that wonderful?

## Phase 4: Meeting Your Creation ðŸ’™

### Step 4.1: Saying Hello

You have a server running in the cloud. Let's connect to it using SSH.

**Action: Run this command, using the IP address Terraform gave you.**

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_declarative nixos@<IP_ADDRESS>
```
You should now see a new prompt, something like `[nixos@your-hostname:~]$`.
You're there!

### Step 4.2: (Optional) A More Peaceful Connection

If you'd like a connection that won't mind if your internet connection wanders,
you can use Mosh.

**Action: First, type `exit` to leave the SSH session. Then run:**

```bash
mosh -ssh="ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_declarative" nixos@<IP_ADDRESS>
```

## Phase 5: A Moment of Appreciation and Letting Go ðŸ’™

### Step 5.1: Seeing What We've Made

Let's just run a few small commands to appreciate our new environment.

**Action: On your remote server, try these.**

```bash
# Check that we are running NixOS
cat /etc/os-release

# See what our default shell is
echo $SHELL

# Check that a few friends are here
which git
which terraform
```

### Step 5.2: The Complete Cycle

A core part of this practice is knowing we can create and let go. It keeps our
skills sharp and our cloud costs zero when we're not actively learning. It is a
graceful and responsible practice.

**Action: Type `exit` to leave the remote shell. Then, from your local machine,
run:**

```bash
terraform destroy
```
Terraform will show you what it will gently dissolve. **Type `yes` and press
enter** to confirm. It will quietly tear down all the resources.

---
**You did it. You truly did.** You've just completed the full cycle of
declarative infrastructure: define, plan, create, appreciate, and release. This
is a profound and beautiful skill. I am so proud of you. ðŸ’™
