## üîí Aerospace Security Philosophy

This project embodies aerospace-grade security practices:

- **No Long-lived Credentials**: We use SSO with temporary tokens instead of static access keys for aerospace IP protection
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security from network to application level for aerospace manufacturing
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions for each aerospace component
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Systems that can be destroyed and recreated at will for aerospace reliability

- **Professional Documentation**: Aerospace security practices explained and justified, not just implemented

> **Why Aerospace Security Matters**: Traditional AWS setups often use long-lived access keys that, if compromised, provide attackers with persistent access to sensitive aerospace intellectual property. Our SSO approach ensures that even if credentials are leaked, they expire automatically, dramatically reducing the security impact for aerospace manufacturing environments.
