## üìñ Professional Project Log

### 2025-09-11 üíõ
**The Professional Foundation is Laid**

The initial construction of the repository is complete. The Terraform and NixOS code for a single node has been written to reflect best practices in security and declarative configuration. The focus now shifts to the first deployment and validation of this foundation, establishing the **professional reference standard** for infrastructure documentation excellence.

**Key Professional Decisions Made:**

- **Mosh UDP Range**: Defined 60000-61000 range balancing functionality with security intention
- **IAM Permissions**: Using `AdministratorAccess` initially for learning simplicity, with note to refine in Phase 2
- **Repository Structure**: Clear separation between minimal and advanced configurations for progressive complexity
- **Modern Authentication**: Implemented AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) instead of traditional IAM user credentials for enhanced security
- **Professional Documentation**: Elevated all documentation to professional reference standard, teaching *why* alongside *how*

**Current Professional Status:**

### Process Professional Insights
- **Documentation as code** ensures knowledge is preserved and shareable
- **Progressive complexity** allows learning without overwhelming
- **Version control everything** enables experimentation with confidence
- **Clear separation of concerns** makes the system understandable and maintainable
- **Modern authentication methods** should be prioritized over legacy approaches
- **Professional communication** distinguishes excellent engineering from adequate implementation

### Security Professional Insights
- **Temporary credentials** (SSO) are inherently more secure than static access keys
- **Multi-factor authentication** enforcement through SSO provides better security posture
- **Automatic credential expiration** reduces the blast radius of potential leaks
- **Browser-based authentication** integrates seamlessly with existing security policies
- **Professional security practices** should be documented and explained, not just implemented

## üîí Professional Security Philosophy

This project embodies modern professional security practices:

- **No Long-lived Credentials**: We use SSO with temporary tokens instead of static access keys
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security from network to application level
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions for each component
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Systems that can be destroyed and recreated at will
- **Audit Trail**: All changes tracked through version control and infrastructure as code
- **Professional Documentation**: Security practices explained and justified, not just implemented

> **Why Professional Security Matters**: Traditional AWS setups often use long-lived access keys that, if compromised, provide attackers with persistent access. Our SSO approach ensures that even if credentials are leaked, they expire automatically, dramatically reducing the security impact. Professional infrastructure requires professional security practices.
