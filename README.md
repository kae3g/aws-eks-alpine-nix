A comprehensive, production-grade reference implementation for deploying sovereign, declarative Kubernetes infrastructure optimized for **aerospace manufacturing and engineering workloads**. This repository establishes the gold standard for **Digital Flight Line Engineering**‚Äîwhere computational infrastructure must be as robust, secure, and precisely engineered as the aircraft it supports. üíô

## Digital Flight Line Engineer Manifesto üíô

**"I build and operate resilient, sovereign technology stacks that empower the world's most critical industries. My work lies at the intersection of high-performance compute, declarative infrastructure, and a mission to advance human potential through flight."**

This repository represents more than infrastructure code‚Äîit is a **blueprint for the digital airframe** that powers modern aerospace manufacturing. Every component is designed to meet the uncompromising standards of precision, reliability, and security required in the aerospace industry.

> **For Aerospace Engineering Teams:** This project demonstrates the infrastructure foundation required for mission-critical aerospace workloads: CAD/CAE simulation, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite element analysis (FEA), and secure intellectual property protection. The declarative approach ensures certifiable consistency from engineer laptops to HPC clusters‚Äîa requirement for FAA certification processes.

## Sovereign Aerospace Innovation üíô

The future of American aerospace dominance depends not just on aerodynamic prowess, but on **digital sovereignty**‚Äîowning and controlling the entire technology stack, from the kernel to the cloud. This ensures maximum efficiency, security, and enables the relentless innovation required to build the world's finest aircraft.

## Beginning Your Aerospace Journey üíô

The established path begins with the `terraform-minimal` configuration‚Äîa single, secure instance that serves as both a validation platform and the foundation for aerospace-scale infrastructure development.

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), and [Nix](https://nixos.org/) prepared on your system.
2. **Follow the Aerospace Guide:** Comprehensive, industry-specific instructions are in the [**SETUP-GUIDE.md**](./SETUP-GUIDE.md).
3. **Deploy with Precision:** Navigate to the `terraform-minimal/` directory and execute the deployment commands.
4. **Track Engineering Progress:** Maintain your Digital Flight Line Engineering journey in [**PROGRESS.md**](./PROGRESS.md).

> **Aerospace Authentication Standard:** This project demonstrates AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) as the enterprise standard for secure cloud access in aerospace manufacturing. SSO provides temporary, secure tokens that meet the stringent security requirements of aerospace industry compliance frameworks.

## Aerospace Philosophy üíô

**Technology should be invisible in its reliability and powerful in its capability!**

This project embodies the aerospace principle that computational infrastructure must be as precisely engineered as the aircraft it supports. We build not for permanence, but for reliability through reproducibility. Every component is designed to be understood, modified, and replaced with confidence‚Äîthe foundation of aerospace-grade engineering.

> **Aerospace Security Philosophy:** We demonstrate modern authentication methods (SSO) that provide temporary credentials instead of long-lived access keys. This establishes the security baseline for aerospace cloud infrastructure and dramatically reduces the risk of intellectual property compromise.

**Precision is not a feature; it is a requirement for safety and performance!** ‚úàÔ∏è
