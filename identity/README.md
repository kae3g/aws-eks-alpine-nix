# 🌙 A Digital Garden of Infinite Possibilities
## Generated: $(date)
## Repository: aws-eks-alpine-nix

## Public Keys
- **GPG**: `$(gpg --fingerprint | grep fingerprint | head -n1 | awk '{print
$NF}')`
- **SSH**: $(cat ssh-public-key.pub)

## Verification
All commits in this repository should be signed with this GPG key.
To verify: `git verify-commit HEAD`

## Philosophy
This identity represents the foundation of our gentle revolution:
- **Sovereign**: Owned entirely by me, not any platform
- **Verifiable**: Cryptographically provable across systems
- **Minimal**: Simple keys without unnecessary complexity
- **Declarative**: Managed through version-controlled configuration

## Usage
This identity signs:
1. Git commits in this repository
2. Built AMI images (via checksums)
3. Terraform plan signatures
4. Kubernetes manifest verification

## Key Management
- **Storage**: GPG private key stored securely with passphrase
- **Backup**: Key material backed up in secure location
- **Expiration**: No expiration - key rotation planned annually
- **Revocation**: Revocation certificate stored separately

## Associated Accounts
- GitHub: https://github.com/$(git config user.name)
- Email: $(git config user.email)
- AWS IAM: $(whoami)-sovereign-identity

## Recovery
If this key is compromised:
1. Use revocation certificate to invalidate key
2. Generate new identity with same philosophy
3. Update all systems with new public keys
4. Re-sign critical artifacts with new key

*This identity enables our gentle revolution in cloud infrastructure.*
