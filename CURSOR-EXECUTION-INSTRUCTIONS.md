## 💙 **Gentle Instructions for Cursor Execution**

To execute these instructions with Cursor, simply copy each phase's commands into your terminal, or use our Haskell `CursorParser` enzyme to transform these natural language instructions into executable commands:

```bash
# Use our Cursor Parser enzyme
./bin/cursor-parser < CURSOR-EXECUTION-INSTRUCTIONS.md
```

*Remember: Each command is designed with gentle care, following Helen Atthowe's principle of no-till gentleness - we create beautiful systems without disturbing the natural harmony of your environment.* 🌸
