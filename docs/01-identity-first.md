# Phase 1: Identity First Philosophy
## The Foundation of Our Gentle Revolution

## Why Identity Comes First

In traditional infrastructure, identity is often an afterthought. In our gentle revolution, identity is the foundation. We begin with cryptographic proof of who we are before we build anything.

This approach ensures:
1. **Sovereignty**: You control your identity, not a platform
2. **Verifiability**: Every action can be cryptographically verified
3. **Auditability**: A clear chain of authorship and responsibility
4. **Portability**: Your identity works across systems and platforms

## The b122m faeb Identity

Your identity consists of two key components:

### 1. GPG Master Key
- **Purpose**: Digital signatures and verification
- **Type**: Ed25519 (modern, secure elliptic curve)
- **Identity**: `yourname (b122m faeb internet identity) <your-email@gmail.com>`
- **Expiration**: None (planned rotation instead)

### 2. SSH Authentication Key
- **Source**: Derived from your GPG key
- **Purpose**: Secure shell access and git operations
- **Benefit**: SSH operations are automatically GPG-signed

## Generating Your Identity

### Step 1: Create GPG Key
```bash
gpg --full-gen-key
```
Choose:
1. `(9) ECC and ECC`
2. `(1) Curve 25519`  
3. `0 = key does not expire`
4. Identity: `fae9b (b122m faeb internet identity) <your.email@gmail.com>`

### Step 2: Extract SSH Key
```bash
gpg --export-ssh-key your.email@gmail.com > ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### Step 3: Configure Git
```bash
git config --global user.name "fae9b"
git config --global user.email "your.email@gmail.com"
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

## Identity Verification

Verify your identity works:

```bash
# Test GPG
echo "test" | gpg --clearsign

# Test SSH
ssh -T git@github.com

# Test git signing
git commit --allow-empty -m "Test signed commit"
git verify-commit HEAD
```

## Philosophy in Practice

This identity-first approach reflects our broader philosophy:

- **Minimalism (faeb)**: Simple keys instead of complex auth systems
- **Declarative (b122m)**: Identity defined through cryptographic facts
- **Sovereign**: You hold the private keys, always
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can verify your work cryptographically

## Next Steps

With your identity established, you can now:
1. Clone this repository securely
2. Make signed commits
3. Build verifiable infrastructure
4. Participate in the gentle revolution

*Your identity is your passport to sovereign infrastructure.*
