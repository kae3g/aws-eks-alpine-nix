### Learning Together

We are all students and teachers in this space. Questions are welcomed and encouraged. No one is expected to know everything, and everyone's journey is valid and valuable.

### Gentle Excellence

We strive for high quality in our work, but we pursue excellence through encouragement and support rather than criticism and pressure. We help each other grow.
