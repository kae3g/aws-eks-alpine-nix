## Current Deployment Status ðŸš€

**We are at a beautiful milestone:** Ready to build our custom Alpine+Nix AMI and deploy our first EKS cluster!

### âœ… What We've Accomplished:
- **Environment Setup Complete:** AWS SSO configured, SSH keys created and imported
- **Infrastructure Code Ready:** Terraform configurations for EKS cluster with custom Alpine+Nix worker nodes
- **AMI Builder Prepared:** Packer template ready to create our custom machine image
- **Documentation Complete:** Gentle, step-by-step guides for every aspect of the journey
- **Repository Organization:** Complete restructure with clean, logical organization
- **Community Building:** Discord group, Instagram presence, and contributing guidelines established

### ðŸš§ What's Currently In Progress:
- **Packer Installation:** Installing Packer with the gentle, manual approach (see README.md for current steps)
- **AMI Building Preparation:** Ready to create our Alpine+Nix EKS worker image

### ðŸ“‹ What's Next:
- **AMI Building:** Creating our custom Alpine+Nix AMI with Packer
- **Cluster Deployment:** Deploying our EKS cluster with Terraform
- **Validation & Testing:** Ensuring everything works beautifully together
- **Documentation Updates:** Capturing our real-world deployment experience
